		**GLOBAL DISTRIBUTED FARMING SYSTEM ThROUGH P2P MACHINERY NETWORK.**


This  farming system empowers agriculture globally using peer to peer machinery networks. This is centered by a highly resilient and efficient system for renting out agricultural machinery like tractor , harvesters in to farmers in our rural  communities.

	**Here we shall implement a peer-to- peer approach as well as  distributed computing** 

**PEER-TO-PEER :** Means we connect the equipment providers(machinery centers) directly with the farmers leveraging locally owned under utilized machine for shearing.
**DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY** occurs with Hybrid cloud ,edge and IOT architecture with computing power to achieve scalability and  reliability.
**THE CLOUD** :  This handles the, farmers registration, machine advertising central booking schedules  , payment processing in a large scale.
IOT : small sensors on machines to monitor location and usage data in real time . This ensures accurate billing preventing customers to lenders disputes .
Edge/FOG : Local devices (like a manager's tablet ) processes critical information and manage bookings locally when central internet is down providing resilience


				**Benefits exist in this system in terms of :**

 **Scalability**: occurs due to cloud horizontal scaling which allows users and machine addition globally. 
 
 **Fault tolerant**: Ability of system to function even when the central internet is down and  occurs at level of cloud data replication across multiple cloud centers . 
 
 **Global collaboration** :exist since cloud base application advertisement covers the whole country linking famers to the  the machine provider center with ease.
